title: Yale Course Selection Advice
---
While at Yale, I took 47 courses for credit. I don't have any means of checking, but there's a reasonable chance this is the greatest number by any member of the Class of 2022 (the minimum for graduation is 36). The following are rules and heuristics for course selection that I picked up over my eight semesters; hopefully, the unique volume of courses I took adds an extra dimension of insight that might be difficult to get elsewhere.

If you're interested in the specific courses I took, as well as my general impressions of them and their instructors, those can be found [here](https://joonhyuklee.github.io/lists-and-ratings) under 'Courses'.
