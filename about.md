title: About Me
---

Hi! My name is Joonhyuk (most people call me Joon), and I recently graduated from Yale University with degrees in Mathematics and Ethics, Politics, & Economics.

For the upcoming year, I'll be working full-time at the University of Chicago under Professors Alex Torgovitsky and Guillaume Pouliot on several econometrics research projects, with a focus on partial identification. In the further future, I plan to pursue a PhD in Economics or a related subject.

Feel free to contact me at joon [dot] lee [at] yale [dot] edu.
