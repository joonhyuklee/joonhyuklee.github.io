title: About Me
---

My name is Joonhyuk (most people call me Joon), and I graduated this May from Yale University with degrees in Mathematics and Ethics, Politics, & Economics. I'll soon be working full-time at the University of Chicago on econometrics theory research, with a focus on partial identification methods. In the future, I plan to obtain a PhD in economics or a related discipline.

Feel free to reach me at joon [dot] lee [at] yale [dot] edu.
